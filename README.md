# E-COMMERCE-CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS

## About
This project leverages Tableau to transform raw customer data into actionable business insights. An interactive dashboard was developed to monitor key metrics such as churn rate, average order value (AOV), loyalty scores, and fraud detection indicators.

## Goal
The main objective is to provide stakeholders with a deeper understanding of customer behavior, highlight retention challenges, and uncover opportunities for growth through dynamic data visualization.

## Dataset (Kaggle)
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains customer-level data including demographics, transaction history, and product interactions across multiple regions.

## Process
The workflow included cleaning and preparing the dataset, defining KPIs, and designing an interactive Tableau dashboard. Features include churn segmentation by country, gender, and product category, as well as dynamic filtering for multi-perspective analysis. The final dashboard enables users to drill down into customer segments, identify risks, and support data-driven decision-making.
